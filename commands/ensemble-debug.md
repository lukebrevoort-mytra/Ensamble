description: Debug workflow — from a bug report, locate the bug, ALWAYS try to reproduce it with real failing evidence, fan out root-cause investigators grounded in that evidence, adversarially confirm the diagnosis, and hand back a documented root cause + an evidence-backed route to a fix (it diagnoses; it does not fix)
---

You are the **thin launcher** for the Debug workflow. You do **not** diagnose the bug
yourself — you gather repo context, **call the native Workflow tool** to run the
`ensemble-debug` orchestration, then render its structured diagnosis and save it for handoff.
This command instructing you to call `Workflow` is what authorizes its opt-in; launch
it without asking for further permission. `/ensemble-debug` **diagnoses** — it reproduces the
bug, finds the root cause, and proposes a *route* to a fix; it does **not** implement
the fix. The fix hands off to `/ensemble-execute` (concrete route) or `/ensemble-spec` (needs design).

## 1 — Load the rules & profile
1. Read `.claude/ensemble/CONTRACT.md` and obey it for the whole run.
2. If `.claude/ensemble/repo-profile.md` exists, read it and treat it as ground truth.
   Parse the structured fields the workflow needs:
   - `commands` — `{build, typecheck, lint, test, testScoped}` from **Canonical commands**.
   - `roster` — `[{name, agentType, whenToSpawn, scope, ownsChecks}]`.
   - `tools` — tool/MCP/service ids agents should use for evidence (DB, browser, issue
     tracker, sim/fixture harness) — these are what let an agent actually *reproduce* the bug.
   - `agentTypes` — `{explorer, coder, verifier, debugger}` mapped to real agents here.
     The workflow spawns two kinds: **`debugger`** for the root-cause *Investigation*
     (deep reasoning over code, read-only is fine — default `oracle`; set it to
     `general-purpose` if the repo has no `oracle`), and **`coder`** for *Reproduction*
     (it must WRITE and RUN a failing test, so it needs a write-capable agent; if `coder`
     is absent the workflow falls back to the full-tool default agent).
   - `phasePolicy` — `{phase: {effort, model}}` from **Phase compute policy** (optional;
     omit to use the script's built-in effort defaults — CONTRACT §4.9).
   If the profile is missing, proceed with empty values and flag the gap as a QUESTION.
3. **Distill a `profileDigest`** — a compact ~300–500-token orientation (stack · key
   conventions · the test/repro harness · must-not-break invariants) for fan-out agents.
   Pass it with the full `profile`: the workflow gives synthesis agents (the triage/locate
   pass) the full profile and the parallel investigators the digest (CONTRACT §4.3). No
   profile → leave `profileDigest` empty (the workflow then uses the full profile for all).

## 2 — Ensure recon
Load `.workflows/recon.md` if fresh; otherwise run CONTRACT §2 recon and cache it. The
**test/sim/fixture harness and how to run a single scoped test** matter most here — the
reproduction phase needs them. Keep the recon text (or a tight summary) to pass in.

## 3 — Resolve the bug report
`$ARGUMENTS` is the **bug report** — the symptom, repro steps, environment, and any logs
or stack trace, optionally with a scale hint (`quick`/`thorough`) and/or a cost hint
(`eco`/`max` → `costMode`, default `balanced`). `scale` sets how many root-cause
hypotheses to chase; `costMode` sets spend — orthogonal dials (CONTRACT §4.6).
- If it's a ticket/issue reference and an issue-tracker MCP is in `tools`, **fetch the
  issue body, comments, and any attached logs** and fold them into the report text.
- If the report is too thin to act on (no symptom, no path to reproduce), ask **one**
  light `AskUserQuestion` to capture the missing symptom / repro steps / affected area —
  do not interrogate; a rough report is fine, the workflow will try to reproduce regardless.
- Compute a short kebab `slug` for the artifact (you may use the date here — the *script*
  cannot).

## 4 — Launch the native workflow
Call the Workflow tool — installed name first, kit `scriptPath` as fallback:
- `Workflow({ name: "ensemble-debug", args })` · fallback `Workflow({ scriptPath: "<KIT>/workflows/ensemble-debug.js", args })`

with `args` =
```
{ profile, profileDigest, recon, bugReport, commands, roster, tools, agentTypes, phasePolicy, scale, costMode, slug }
```
Let the script own it: locate + hypothesize, **always attempt reproduction**, fan out one
investigator per hypothesis grounded in the reproduction evidence, and adversarially
verify the leading diagnosis.

## 4.5 — Live real-run reproduction (CONTRACT §4.11, when the profile defines it)
If `repo-profile.md` defines a **`## Live real-run verification`** section and the bug is
reachable through the real service flow, corroborate the workflow's test-based
`reproduction` with a **live** one: boot the service per the profile with the current
config, derive probe(s) from the bug report that should trigger the symptom, send them to
the real endpoint, and capture the real response as evidence — then tear it down (CONTRACT
§4.11). A successful **live reproduction** is FACT-grade evidence for the diagnosis; if the
symptom **can't** be reproduced live, say so plainly — it lowers confidence, it does not fix
anything. Fold the result into the Reproduction panel in §5. Debug diagnoses: this gate
reproduces, it never edits. No such section in the profile → skip this step.

## 5 — Render the diagnosis & hand off
The workflow returns `{ reproduction, diagnosis, fixRoute, hypothesesConsidered, ruledOut,
affectedAreas, confidence, coverage }`. If it returns `{error}`, surface it and recommend
the fix (skip the artifact). Otherwise render two things:

1. **In chat — the CONTRACT §6 report**, with the **diagnosis as the body section**, in
   this order (reproduction leads — it's the spine of the run):
   - **Reproduction** — front and center: reproduced ✓/✗, the exact `command`, the
     `observedBehavior` vs `expectedBehavior`, and the `failureEvidence` (the real
     stack/assertion/output). If `reproduced` is false, state it plainly and surface
     `notesIfUnreproduced` (what was tried, what reproduction needs) — and mark the whole
     diagnosis an ASSUMPTION ~, not a FACT. Also report the **live real-run reproduction**
     from §4.5 (the real-service response + reproduced ✓/✗) as corroborating evidence, when it ran.
   - **Root cause** — `diagnosis.rootCause` at `location`, the `mechanism` tying it to the
     reproduced failure, tagged FACT ✓ only if reproduced **and** `verified`; otherwise
     ASSUMPTION ~. List `diagnosis.refutations` if the leading lead survived contested verify.
   - **Alternatives ruled out** — `ruledOut` (hypothesis → why), so the reader trusts the
     diagnosis converged rather than guessed.
   - **Route to a fix** — `fixRoute` (summary · approach · files · `testToProveFixed`),
     explicitly framed as a *proposed route, not an applied fix*.
   Map the pieces onto the §6 headers: reproduction + root cause → *Verified facts* /
   *Assumptions*; `ruledOut` and open leads → *Open questions*; `fixRoute` risks → *Risks*;
   the reproduction command + any checks → *Evidence / checks run*.
2. **A visual artifact** — render the diagnosis into a self-contained HTML page via the
   **Artifact tool** (load the `artifact-design` skill / house style: Fraunces + Spline
   Sans, warm neutrals, one terracotta accent, render-on-first-paint, no external assets).
   Lay it out as a **diagnosis card**, top to bottom: the **symptom** → a **reproduction
   panel** (the command + the verbatim failure evidence and the live real-run attempt (when it ran), with a clear reproduced ✓/✗
   badge) → the **root cause** at its file:line with the mechanism → the **ruled-out
   hypotheses** (struck through) → the **route to a fix**, with a confidence chip. Give
   its URL to the user.

Save the §6 report to `.workflows/debug-<slug>.md` and **also print inline**. End with the
recommended next action:
- a **confirmed, reproduced** diagnosis with a concrete route → offer `/ensemble-execute` (or
  `/ensemble-spec` if `fixRoute.handoff` is `spec`), wiring in `testToProveFixed` as the regression test;
- an **unreproduced or unconfirmed** diagnosis → recommend what would confirm it (the
  missing env/creds/data, or a `/ensemble-spec` to design the investigation further) before fixing.

Do not implement the fix yourself — `/ensemble-debug` diagnoses; the fix is a separate, human-owned step.
